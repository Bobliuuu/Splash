**Acknowledgements:** 

Thank you Design Team 1 for making this experience what it could be :) 

<summary> To everyone at SHAD, I give my sincerest thanks, and I've decided to attach my final words here, so that this journey can be forever remembered: </summary>
<details>
SHAD has been such a wonderful experience; I've made so many friends, got so many memories, and found so many new hobbies I’ve never even thought about before. From the amazing activities and workshops to Sanjay (who is obviously equally amazing), I learned so many new things. I wouldn’t even try to list the exhilarating experiences I had; it ended before it seemed like it had even started. Thank you everyone for making this experience incredible, and I’ll always remember this memorable and honestly surreal experience; I’d relive this moment in a heartbeat. Many of us are sentimental at this “last moment”, this last “fork in the road”; but this doesn’t have to be a goodbye; we’re just parting ways for a while. And as Robert Frost once said, all roads lead somewhere; but if SHAD has taught me one thing, its that whatever road we take, all roads will ultimately lead to success. See you all soon.
